# To insert a row into a table only if a unique key constraint is not violated, you can use the INSERT IGNORE statement in SQL. Here's an example of a SQL query that inserts a new row into a users table if the username field is unique:



SQL= """INSERT IGNORE INTO users(username, email, password)
VALUES('johndoe', 'johndoe@example.com', 'mypassword')"""

# In this example, the users table has a unique key constraint on the username field. If the username 'johndoe' does not already exist in the table, the INSERT IGNORE statement will insert a new row with the specified values into the table. If the username already exists in the table, the INSERT IGNORE statement will not insert a new row and will not raise an error.

# Note that the INSERT IGNORE statement is specific to MySQL and some other database management systems. If you're using a different database management system, the syntax may be different.
